# Frontend for "to-do" app

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/) and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Functionalities:
### Login, sign up, logout:
    You will need to be authenticated to use the "to-do list" functionality.
### CRUD for "tasks":
    You can create, delete and edit your tasks.

## Technologies:

### [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing.

### [Context](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Installation to run locally:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies:
    ~~~
    npm install

- To start the development server:

note that you will not be able to use its functionalities unless you launch the [backend server](https://github.com/fedenazar97/backend-DRF-api-tasks).
